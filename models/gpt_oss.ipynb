Likely GPT-4? \"GPT OSS\" maybe they refer to GPT Open Source? Or GPT-3? They might want to know memory usage for GPT inference? On an RTX 4090 GPU, how much memory should be reserved for GPT? The question: \"how much memory to reserve for gpt oss on a 4090 rtx gpu\".\\n\\nWe need to interpret: \"gpt oss\" might be \"GPT-3.5 Turbo\" or \"OpenAI GPT\"? They might refer to \"GPT-OSS\" open-source GPT? Maybe \"gpt-oss\" refers to \"gpt-oss\" version of GPT? I\\'d ask: In context of memory usage for inference models, we need to consider GPU memory usage: model weights, activation memory, optimizer state, etc. For inference, no optimizer. For training, large overhead.\\n\\nThe RTX 4090 has 24GB of GDDR6X memory. So how much to reserve? Might be about 16GB for model and intermediate buffers.\\n\\nWe can approximate: For GPT-2 medium (355M) takes ~1.4GB. GPT-3 175B would need ~700GB of memory, so can\\'t run. For GPT-4, also huge. So maybe the user wants to know how much to reserve for GPT-3.5? That would also be huge. But maybe they refer to \"GPT-OSS\" as \"GPT Open Source\" like GPT-J or GPT-NeoX. For GPT-J 6B, weight size ~6GB (FP32). So 24GB is enough for 6B. For GPT-NeoX 20B ~20GB. So they\\'d need to reserve maybe 8GB for overhead.\\n\\nThus answer: Reserve about 12-15GB for model+activations. Or answer: It depends on model size and context length.\\n\\nWe can give guidelines: For inference, you need to allocate memory for weights (float32 or float16), plus activation buffers (~2-4x weight size). So for a 6B model (~6GB weights FP32), you need ~20GB for inference. For 20B (~20GB weights FP32), you need ~80GB, impossible.\\n\\nAlternatively, if using 8-bit quantization, you can fit.\\n\\nThus answer: For 4090, you can fit GPT-J with 6B if you use FP32 weights (6GB) and you need about 20-22GB for activations. So reserve ~22GB.\\n\\nAlternatively, for GPT-NeoX 20B with fp16, 10GB weights + 30-40GB activations.\\n\\nWe can give numbers: For GPT-2 medium: ~1.4GB weights, ~4GB activations -> ~5.4GB.\\n\\nBut the question: \"how much memory to reserve for gpt oss on a 4090 rtx gpu\" maybe they want to run GPT-OSS inference on GPU. They might be using huggingface transformers and want to know how much memory to leave for GPU for other tasks. So answer: leave at least 8GB for OS etc, so you can use 16GB for GPT model. But no, they ask \"how much memory to reserve\" maybe they want to set environment variable like CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES? Not sure.\\n\\nWe can respond: It depends on model size, precision, batch size, context length. For typical GPT-NeoX 20B, you need >70GB, so can\\'t run. For GPT-2 or GPT-J, you can run.\\n\\nWe can propose: For GPT-J 6B in FP16, you need ~20-22GB. So reserve 22GB. For GPT-NeoX 20B in FP16, you need >60GB.\\n\\nWe can also mention GPU memory fragmentation, and you might want to keep ~2-4GB free.\\n\\nThus answer: For 4090 (24GB), you can run GPT-J in FP16 with 20-22GB. For GPT-2 or smaller, less.\\n\\nWrap up: Provide a table of recommended memory usage for different GPT models at different precisions: FP32, FP16, INT8. Summarize: For inference, memory usage is roughly 2-4x weight size. So for 6B weights (~6GB), memory ~20GB.\\n\\nAlso mention that for training you need double.\\n\\nThus final answer: Provide guidelines.assistantfinal**Short answer:**  \\nOn a RTX\\u202f4090 (24\\u202fGB GDDR6X) you will typically want to **reserve ~20–22\\u202fGB for a 6‑B‑parameter GPT‑style model (e.g. GPT‑J, GPT‑NeoX‑6B) running in FP16** and keep the remaining 2–4\\u202fGB free for the OS, CUDA runtime, driver buffers, and any auxiliary workloads.  \\n\\nBelow is a practical cheat‑sheet that explains *why* that number is what it is and how it scales with model size, precision, batch‑size, and context‑length.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1.
